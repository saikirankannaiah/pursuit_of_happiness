## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
I'm intrigued by the notion of Happiness being associated with country where they live in, individual's income and their respective countries GDP. Is Happiness so trivial to predict or associate with such factors? Is there really a Dystopia? This question persuaded me to analyze world happiness reports from 2015 to 2019 . I would like to answer these following questions in this process

1.  What are happiest countries in the world?
2.  What are common amongst these happy countries? What makes these countries happy?
3.  Are there any anomalies amongst these happy countries?
4.  What are the happiest countries in the making?
5.  Is happiness obvious to predict?

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. 
For the users who prefer working with other python virtual envs, inside your env run these following commands
```
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install scikit-learn
pip install jupyterlab
```
